DESCRIPTION:

You challenge is to create a responsive flip card. 
The user should be able to hover or click on the card 
and it needs to flip on the other side to reveal what's on the back. 

Remember: the card needs to be responsive - as I change the size of my window, 
the card needs to adjust to the new size and look natural.
